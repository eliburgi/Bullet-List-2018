# Bullet-List-2018
My development goals for the second half of 2018. Each of the completed projects below will have its own repository and is open source. 

### Create the following apps using Flutter:

<ul>
  <li> <del> Hello-Flutter: Getting started with Flutter and Dart. </del> </li>
  <li> <del> Number-Facts: Random Facts about numbers and dates using http://numbersapi.com. </del> </li>
  <li> todo: Todo-App with local persistence following the Redux paradigm. Furthermore, try incorporating smooth micro-transactions using Flutter animations. Something like this awesome design: https://dribbble.com/shots/3837693-Todo-app-concept</li>
  <li> Weather-Forecast: Simple weather forecast app using https://openweathermap.org/api. </li>
  <li> Tinder-Like-Cards: Create a widget like TinderÂ´s swipeable cards. </li>
  <li> Butterfly: App that suggests you what to do spontaneously. Uses widget from previous point. </li>
</ul>
